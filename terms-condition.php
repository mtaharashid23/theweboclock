                    processing time for revisions would be 48 hours.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>1. If the first design ideas are accepted, or a revision is required, any deposit payments
                            for a project will not be refunded after delivery unless Westgreensolutionsllc cancels or
                            terminated your Agreement for a cause other than your violation or non-performance.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>2. All reimbursement claims will be processed according to the following procedure:</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>3. When the first logo concepts are shown, you submit a request. The refund offer goes void
                            after you accept or request modifications to the design elements, and refund requests will
                            not be considered.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>4. If you refund before the initial design concepts are delivered, you will be eligible for a
                            full refund (less 10 percent service & processing fee).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>5. If you seek a refund within 48 hours, you will receive a 66 percent return (less 10
                            percent service & processing fee).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>6. If you seek a refund between 48 and 120 hours after the original design delivery, you will
                            receive a 33 percent refund (minus 10% service fee).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>7. After 120 hours, no refund requests will be considered; however, because we strive for 100
                            percent customer satisfaction, you are urged to contact us if you have any concerns.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>8. If you have not taken any action on your order for 30 days after ordering it, you will not
                            be eligible for a refund. If you wish to reactivate your design order, you'll have to pay a
                            cost that varies based on the project.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>9. After the final files have been given, no refund claims will be considered.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>10. When it comes to website packages, no refunds will be given once the development has been
                            done and the website has gone online.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>11. Just after storyboard is developed, no refund requests for video animation packages will
                            be considered.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>12. Any refund requests should be sent to the customer service department. Westgreensolutionsllc
                            retains the right to approve or deny your request on an individual case-by-case basis
                            depending on your breach of your user agreement.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>13. The return policy for Westgreensolutionsllc / Custom packages will be the same as it is for
                            single products.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>14. For example, if you buy a logo and web design service and accept the logo, you can only
                            get a refund for the website service during the first design.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>15. A legitimate cause for requesting a refund must be evaluated against the design brief and
                            cuts.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>16. A legitimate explanation must be provided for a refund request, which must be evaluated
                            against the design brief and client input for changes. A refund will not be offered unless
                            the concept is not developed according to the brief; nevertheless, more changes will be
                            supplied until total satisfaction is achieved.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>17. The money-back promise is contingent on the order being placed in good faith. We do not
                            consider it good faith when a consumer places design orders with many design agencies for
                            the same work in the hopes of receiving a refund. We retain the right to refuse a refund
                            request in this situation.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>18. Customer input is required for all design tasks before the design can be finalized,
                            therefore it is just a matter of time.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>19. If our designed logo is discovered to be significantly similar to another logo design
                            that may already exist, our 100% unique design guarantee entitles you to a re-draw.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
